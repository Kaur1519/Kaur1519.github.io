          <p>Biryani is a delicious rice dish peppered with scrumptious spices like saffron and cumin and further layered with spiced meat or veggie protein. Typically, this layered rice dish is enriched with added yogurt or ghee, a clarified butter, for an extra boost of luxurious flavor.  While biryani can be made with many different types of rice such as seeraga samba or jeerakasala, long-grain basmati rice is typically the main grain used.The spices within biryani really allow this dish to shine, with garam masala being a simple but great choice to infuse a rainbow of flavor into every bite. Nuts and seeds such as succulent cardamom pods often feature, providing crunchy texture along with fried onions and dried fruit.There are many different ways to cook biryani, though the most common is likely the dum method. This is a slow-cooking technique in which the rice is layered raw. </p>

         <h2> Recipe of Biryani</h2>
         <ol>
             <li>Soak the rice in 3 cups water for 30 minutes. After the rice has soaked, drain the water using a colander.</li>
             <li> Heat a pot full of water, add 3 green cardamom, 2 cloves and 3/4 teaspoon salt to it. Let it come to a boil. Add rice, stir with a spoon.</li>
             <li>Let it cook uncovered until it's almost cooked. There should be a bite to it. This takes around 6 to 7 minutes. Remove pan from heat and drain rice in a colander. You may add a teaspoon of ghee to the rice. Set aside.</li>
             <li>Heat 1.5 tablespoons ghee in a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add 1 sliced onion to it and cook until they turn golden brown. Now add cashews and cook until golden brown, around 1 to 2 minutes. Add potato, cook for 2 minutes until light brown.</li>
             <li>To the same pan, now add cauliflower, beans and carrots. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes until veggies appear light brown.</li>
             <li>Add the biryani masala and kashmiri red chili powder. Add 1/4 cup water. Let it cook for around 6 to 7 minutes until veggies are almost cooked but not overcooked. They should be firm to bite.</li>
             <li>Now take a heavy bottom pan. I first grease the bottom of the pan with ghee. Then add a layer of rice (half of the rice).Top with half of fried onion, half of fried cashews and half of cilantro and mint. Add 1/2 teaspoon of rose water. Now place the veggies on top (all of it).</li>
